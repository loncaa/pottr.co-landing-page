## 🔐 Fighting Phishing with AI and Real-Time Intelligence

At **PhishAR**, I worked as a **backend developer** focused on building the core infrastructure for a mobile app aimed at **preventing phishing attacks**. The app empowers users to take a photo of their screen, extract visible URLs, and instantly analyze the threat level of the domains detected.

### Key Technologies:
- **Node.js**
- **Firebase**

### Core Contributions:
- Integrated multiple **third-party threat intelligence services** to gather information about scanned URLs.
- Built a streamlined data **aggregation and parsing engine** that unified complex data into a cohesive, readable security report.
- Implemented **asynchronous operations** to prevent server blocking while fetching data from external APIs.
- Focused heavily on **performance and reliability**, ensuring fast and meaningful insights for users.

### Technical Challenges:
- Dealing with inconsistent data formats from different security providers.
- Ensuring server responsiveness while managing long-lasting third-party API calls.
- Designing a backend that could evolve as the product scaled.

### Key Technologies:
- **JavaScript**
- **Next.js**
